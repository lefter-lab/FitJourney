# 🏋️ FitJourney

FitJourney is a fitness and workout tracking platform built with Spring Boot.

The application allows trainers to create workout programs, while users can enroll, track their progress, and submit reviews.

---

## Course Context

This project was developed as an individual project assignment for the Spring Fundamentals course at SoftUni.

The project demonstrates the practical application of Spring Boot fundamentals, including MVC architecture, Thymeleaf views, Spring Data JPA, Spring Security, validation, role-based access control, and basic CRUD functionality.

# Security

* Spring Security authentication and authorization
* Session-based login
* Authenticated user's UUID stored in HTTP session
* BCrypt password hashing
* Guest users can access only public pages
* Authenticated users can access protected pages
* Role checks implemented with Spring Security and `@PreAuthorize`
* Trainer ownership validation for edit, deactivate, and delete operations
* USER-only actions restricted to USER role

### Session Authentication

After successful login:

```java
session.setAttribute("user_id", user.getId());
```

The authenticated user's UUID is stored in the HTTP session as required by the project specification.

---

# Validation and Error Handling

The application uses Jakarta Validation for server-side validation.

Validation is applied to:

* Registration form
* Workout program creation form
* Workout program edit form
* Enrollment progress update form
* Workout review submission form

Business rules:

* A user cannot enroll twice in the same program
* Progress must be between 0 and 100
* A user cannot submit multiple reviews for the same program
* Trainers cannot modify programs owned by other trainers

Custom exceptions:

* `ProgramNotFoundException`
* `UserNotFoundException`
* `EnrollmentNotFoundException`
* `DuplicateEnrollmentException`
* `DuplicateReviewException`
* `UnauthorizedProgramAccessException`

---

# Database

* Spring Data JPA
* UUID primary keys for all entities
* Relational database (MySQL)
* BCrypt hashed passwords

Relationships:

* User → WorkoutProgram
* User → Enrollment
* WorkoutProgram → Enrollment
* User → WorkoutReview
* WorkoutProgram → WorkoutReview

---

# Scheduling

### Archive Inactive Programs

Automatically archives inactive workout programs.

### Complete Finished Enrollments

Automatically updates enrollments with 100% progress to COMPLETED status.

---

# Caching

Program listings are cached using:

```java
@Cacheable("programs")
```

Cache is cleared using:

```java
@CacheEvict
```

when programs are created, edited, deactivated, deleted, or archived.

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

* Java 17
* Maven
* MySQL

## Setup

Clone repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lefter-lab/FitJourney.git
cd FitJourney
```

Create database:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE fitjourney;
```

Configure `application.properties`:

```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/fitjourney
spring.datasource.username=YOUR_DB_USERNAME
spring.datasource.password=YOUR_DB_PASSWORD
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
```

Run application:

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Open:

```text
http://localhost:8080
```
## Test Roles Setup

Newly registered accounts receive the USER role by default.

To test TRAINER and ADMIN functionality, update the desired user role directly in the database after registration.

Example

```sql
UPDATE users
SET role = 'TRAINER'
WHERE username = 'trainer';

UPDATE users
SET role = 'ADMIN'
WHERE username = 'admin';
```

Recommended Test Accounts
Register a regular user account through /register.
Register a trainer account through /register, then update its role to TRAINER.
Register an admin account through /register, then update its role to ADMIN.

After changing roles in the database, log out and log in again for the new permissions to take effect.
